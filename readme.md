# Ping Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using Python's turtle graphics library. The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle on the left and right sides of the screen. The objective is to hit the ball back and forth, trying to make the opponent miss the ball. When a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 10.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` module to start the game.
2. Use the `W` and `S` keys to control the left paddle, and the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to control the right paddle.
3. The ball will start moving in a random direction, and the players must hit it back and forth using their paddles.
4. If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
5. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 10.
